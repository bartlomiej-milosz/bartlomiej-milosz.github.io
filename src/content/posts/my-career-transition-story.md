title: 'How Architecture Led Me to Data Analytics'

After four years as an interior architect, I realized I was spending as much time analyzing data as I was designing spaces. **I found myself more excited about the analytical work than the design itself.** That realization led me to pursue data analytics, turning my architecture skills into a foundation for solving business problems.

## The Discovery

The turning point came during complex residential projects when I realized **my Excel work was becoming more sophisticated than my design work.** Detailed budget spreadsheets tracking hundreds of cost variables—every fixture, system, and material component. Material comparison matrices weighing durability, cost, and aesthetics across dozens of options.

I remember sitting at my desk with two monitors—one filled with detailed comparative spreadsheets, the other showing design layouts waiting for my attention. **I was more interested in the data insights than finalizing the design.**

That's when I asked myself: _What if I could help not just individual families optimize their investments, but assist businesses in optimizing strategies and understanding their customers?_ The answer pointed straight to data analytics.

## Building the Foundation

Once I knew data analytics was my direction, the job descriptions were intimidating: 

- 3+ years Python experience
- SQL proficiency required
- Machine learning algorithms

I had basic programming skills but none of the specialized expertise.

Then I saw a LinkedIn post: _"The biggest challenge in data analytics isn't technical skills—it's communicating insights to stakeholders who don't understand data."_

**Lightbulb moment.** I'd been translating complex technical concepts for non-technical clients for four years. I'd guided families through major investment decisions, explaining design implications in language they could understand.

Maybe my architecture background was more transferable than I'd thought.

I chose a two-track approach: Computer Science studies at PJATK Warsaw for technical depth, plus Maven Analytics courses for immediate data specialization.

**What I realized about transferable skills:**

- **Requirements gathering** = Understanding business problems before jumping to solutions
- **Stakeholder management** = Translating technical insights for different audiences
- **Project coordination** = Managing complex projects with multiple dependencies
- **Business perspective** = Understanding how insights translate to decisions

I wasn't changing careers—**I was applying the same core skills to different problems.**

## Where I Am Now

Today, I'm actively interviewing for junior data analyst positions while completing my CS studies.

**What's changed:**

- **Technical skills:** Comfortable with Python, SQL, and Excel for data analysis
- **Confidence:** I can explain how architecture experience transfers to data work
- **Portfolio:** Projects showcasing analytics capabilities

**What hasn't changed:**

- **Core strengths:** Problem-solving, stakeholder communication, systematic thinking
- **Business perspective:** Understanding how data drives decisions

## Key Lessons for Career Changers

1. **Clarity comes through doing, not thinking.** I discovered my path through experimentation and building, not endless research. Career transitions are gradual discoveries.

2. **Your existing skills are your foundation.** Don't underestimate transferable value. I understand business problems better than many junior analysts because of my client experience.

3. **Technical skills develop faster than business acumen.** Communication skills and stakeholder management take years to develop—and you might already have them.

## What's Next

I'm seeking junior data analyst roles where I can leverage Python, SQL, and my business communication skills. **Am I done transitioning?** Absolutely not. I'm still learning, still building, still improving.

The best career decisions aren't the ones that feel obviously right from the start—they're the ones you make right through consistent effort and willingness to keep learning.

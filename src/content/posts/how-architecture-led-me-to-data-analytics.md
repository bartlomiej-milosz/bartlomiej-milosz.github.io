title: 'How Architecture Led Me to Data Analytics'

After four years as an interior architect, I realized I was spending as much time analyzing data as designing spaces. **I found myself more excited about the analytical work than the design itself.** That realization led me to pursue data analytics, turning my architecture skills into a foundation for solving business problems.

## The Discovery

The turning point came during complex residential projects when **my Excel work was becoming more sophisticated than my design work.** Detailed budget spreadsheets tracking hundreds of cost variables—every fixture, system, and material component. Material comparison matrices weighing durability, cost, and aesthetics across dozens of options.

I remember sitting with two monitors—one filled with comparative spreadsheets, the other showing design layouts waiting for attention. **I was more interested in the data insights than finalizing the design.**

That's when I asked myself: _What if I could help businesses optimize strategies and understand their customers, not just individual families optimize their investments?_ The answer pointed straight to data analytics.

## The Transition

Initial job descriptions were intimidating: "3+ years Python experience," "SQL proficiency required," "Machine learning algorithms." Then I saw a LinkedIn post: _"The biggest challenge in data analytics isn't technical skills—it's communicating insights to stakeholders who don't understand data."_

**Lightbulb moment.** I'd been translating complex technical concepts for non-technical clients for four years, guiding families through major investment decisions.

My architecture background was more transferable than I'd thought:

- **Requirements gathering** = Understanding business problems before jumping to solutions
- **Stakeholder management** = Translating technical insights for different audiences  
- **Project coordination** = Managing complex projects with multiple dependencies
- **Business perspective** = Understanding how insights translate to decisions

I chose a two-track approach: Computer Science studies at PJATK Warsaw for technical depth, plus Maven Analytics courses for immediate specialization.

## Where I Am Now

Today, I'm actively seeking junior data analyst positions while completing my CS studies.

**Technical skills:** Python, SQL, and Excel for data analysis  
**Core strengths:** Problem-solving, stakeholder communication, systematic thinking  
**Business perspective:** Understanding how data drives decisions

## Lessons for Career Changers

**Your existing skills are your foundation.** Don't underestimate transferable value. I understand business problems because of my client experience.

**Technical skills develop faster than business acumen.** Communication and stakeholder management take years to develop—you might already have them.

**Clarity comes through doing, not endless planning.** I discovered my path through experimentation and building.

## What's Next

I'm seeking junior data analyst roles where I can leverage Python, SQL, and my business communication skills. The best career decisions aren't the ones that feel obviously right from the start—they're the ones you make right through consistent effort and willingness to keep learning.

# Hello, I'm Bartek ðŸ‘‹

I've spent 4+ years _helping families make their biggest investment decisions_ â€” designing homes that work for their lives.

Now I'm applying that same analytical approach to help businesses make sense of their data.

<u>Architecture taught me:</u>

- how to break down complex problems
- communicate clearly with stakeholders
- turn requirements into solutions

I'm building on this foundation with **Computer Science studies at PJATK** and hands-on experience in **Python, SQL, and Excel.** Ready to bring systematic thinking to your data challenges.
